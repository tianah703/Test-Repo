OH BOY HOW EXCITING!
A broad line of sight, aided by wide, rectangular-shaped pupils, allows goats to see danger approaching from their peripheral vision.
Goatsâ€™ pupils (like many hooved animals) are rectangular. This gives them vision for 320 to 340 degrees (compared to humans with 160-210) around them without having to move and they are thought to have excellent night vision.
